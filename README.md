# üêäü§ñ COINGATOR: Statistical Rusty Searcher üëæ‚ú®

<br>

**This program implements an arb searcher running statistical arbitrage strategies to several exchanges. It's called coingator because it's a cute animal that rhymes with cointegratoooor.**

For more details about this project, check my Mirror post, **[bot #2: coingator, a rusty statistical searcher]()**.

## strategies

> One of the most well-known strategies among different **algorithmic trading methods** is
the **statistical arbitrage strategy**: a profitable situation stemming from **pricing inefficiencies among financial markets**. Statistical arbitrage is a mere strategy to obtain profit by applying **past statistics**.

<br>

#### cointegration

* [cointegration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration) is the **test correlation between two or more non-stationary time series** for a specified period (identifying long-run parameters and determining when stationary time series do not depart from equilibrium).

>  Formally, if **(X,Y,Z)** are each integrated of order **d**, and there exist coefficients **a, b, c** such that **aX + bY + cZ** is integrated of the order less than **d**, then **X**, **Y**, and **Z** are cointegrated.


* in this tool, we implement this strategy with the following steps:

```
    1. retrieve a list of tradeable symbols
    2. generate price history
    3. identify cointegrated pairs
    4. identify trends
    5. backtest
```

<br>

## monitoring


#### with [bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/)

* using this code, we use websockets and bybit's API to monitor the following:

```
    * spot pair orderbook, depth, k-lines, and private execution reports
    * inverse public orderbooks, trades, insurances, perpetuals, futures, liquidations
    * inverse private positions, executions, stop orders
```

* to create a trading bot, you can select: pair, price range, number of grids, and total investment.

#### subscribing to topics on a derivative

<br>

> **Crypto derivatives** are financial contracts that derive their values from underlying assets. **Crypto futures** contracts are proxy tools to speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrencies or to be used to hedge against their price changes.

<br>

Select `1`:

```
üêä welcome to coingator ü™ô. type your option:

‚û° 1: sub to public topics for a derivative (e.g., ETHUSDT)
```

<br>

This will open a websocket with bybit and subscribe to the following derivative's topics:

```
- depths
- trades
- book tickers
- realtimes
```


<br>

Example output:


```

* [Cointegration-Based Pairs Trading Strategy in the Cryptocurrency Market (arxiv:2109.10662)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10662)
    - *"By considering the main limitations in the market microstructure, our
strategy exceeds the naive buy-and-hold approach in the Bitmex exchange. Another
significant finding is that we implement a numerous collection of cryptocurrency coins
to formulate the model‚Äôs spread, which improves the risk-adjusted profitability of the
pairs trading strategy. Besides, the strategy‚Äôs maximum drawdown level is reasonably
low, which makes it useful to be deployed. The results also indicate that a class of
coins has better potential arbitrage opportunities than others."*
