### small projects


<br>

* **[a sparse merkle tree library from scratch](sparse-merkle-tree)**: a beautiful theoretical walkthrough and library on **authenticated data structures** and **sparse merkle trees**, including full unit and fuzzing test cases
* **[solana dev onboarding](https://github.com/urani-trade/solana-dev-onboarding-rs)**: development resources aiming to onboard engineers and scientists to solana development
* **[web3-toolkit-rs](https://github.com/autistic-symposium/web3-toolkit-rs):** a very basic crate for blockchain projects
* **[kiddor arb searcher](kiddor-searcher-bot):** an (unfinished) package implements a boilerplate with tools to run a **searcher with statistical arbitrage strategies**. it utilizes libraries from my (never-finished) crate at **[web3-toolkit-rs](https://github.com/autistic-symposium/web3-toolkit-rs)**

### experiments with foundry

<br>

* **[comparisons of flashloans fees and functions on ethereum](foundry-flashloans):** leveraging **foundry** to compare flashloans from **leading lending protocols on ethereum**, including deployment cost and deployment size
* **[inspecting evm-based blockchains history](foundry-historical):** leveraging **foundry** to analyze blockchain historical data. this type of strategy can be used for several purposes, including **testing vulnerabilities or extracting mev data**
* **[my ethernaut solutions and writeups in foundry](https://github.com/autistic-symposium/ethernaut-systematic-solutions-foundry-sol)**: a framework in foundry to solve hacking problems, exemplified with solutions for openzeppelin's ethernaut wargames. leveraging foundry, each level has a test set `(.t.sol)`, a script set `(.s.sol)`, and a write-up. some levels also have an exploit at `src/.sol`
