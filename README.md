## experiments with foundry

<br>

* **[comparisons of flashloans fees and functions on ethereum](foundry-flashloans):**
  * leverage **foundry** to compare flashloans from **leading lending protocols on ethereum**, including deployment cost and deployment size. 

<br>

* **[inspecting evm-based blockchains history](foundry-historical):**
  * leverage **foundry** to analyze blockchain historical data. this type of strategy can be used for several purposes, including **testing vulnerabilities or extracting mev data.**

<br>

* **[my ethernaut solutions and writeups in foundry](https://github.com/go-outside-labs/ethernaut-foundry-writeups-sol)**
  * solutions for openzeppelin's ethernaut wargames. leveraging foundry, each level has a test set `(.t.sol)`, a script set `(.s.sol)`, and a write-up. some levels also have an exploit at `src/.sol`.

## other of my projects

<br>


* **[kiddor arb searcher](kiddor-searcher-bot):**
  * this package implements a boilerplate with tools to run a **searcher with statistical arbitrage strategies**. it utilizes libraries from my crate at **[web3-toolkit-rs](https://github.com/go-outside-labs/web3-toolkit-rs)**.
  * (i never finished this bot, but maybe i will someday).

<br>

* **[web3-toolkit-rs](https://github.com/go-outside-labs/web3-toolkit-rs):**
  - an *on-going* crate for blockchain projects.
